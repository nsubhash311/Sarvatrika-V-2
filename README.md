Version 2 of project Sarvatrika

Prediction in machine learning works well, but still it is highly error-prone. Machine Learning models  are capable of processing huge amounts of data. As the  amount and type  of data varies, the algorithms will also vary. Algorithm selection is a manual and tedious task to run models with different algorithms and identify the most accurate algorithm based on the results. Selecting different algorithms for different types of data is the major disadvantage. And as a solution to this, here comes a universal method, “Sarvatrika”.

Savatrika is the idea of introducing a universal prediction method. Since each and every prediction is dependent on the dataset, no constant algorithm can be used for prediction. Only after analysing the datasets the algorithm can be chosen. We here introduced an universal prediction where our Savatrika does everything in automation. It analyzes the dataset and chooses a perfect machine learning prediction algorithm  and then trains the dataset that results in a machine learning model which predicts values.
